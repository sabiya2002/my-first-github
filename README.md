<h2> "Why do we need to learn these two skills at the start?"

 </h2>
You might be wondering why I chose to learn these two skills first.

I made this roadmap based on a beginner’s level and my own experience.

I tried many roadmaps from ChatGPT and YouTube but couldn’t follow them.

Taking notes was hard, and when I stopped learning for a while, reviewing them later confused me.

So today, I decided to store my notes and practice in one place, making them easy to use now and in the future.

We all know GitHub and Git are the best platforms for this.

Whatever I learn on my journey, I’ll share it so others like me can benefit from my tips and tricks.

This will help both me and you track our progress and stay disciplined.
